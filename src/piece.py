    Representing the 21 Blokus shapes, as named and defined by
    the string representations in shape_definitions.py.

    The can_be_transformed boolean indicates whether or not
    the origin was explicitly defined in the string
    representation of the shape.

    See shape_definitions.py for more details.

    NOTE: The presence of the origin attribute in this class
    is a design bug. All points in the squares list, which define
    the shape, should be relative to an implicit origin of (0, 0).
    Most string representations in shape_definitions refer to
    origins explicitly (using the 'O' and '@') characters: those
    origins should be used by Shape.from_string to define the
    squares of the shape (relative to an origin of (0, 0)). But
    after doing so, the origin used in the string representation
    is no longer needed anywhere in our design or implementation.
    To remain backwards compatible with the original design, you
    can implement the constructor and Shape.from_string to set the
    Shape object's origin attribute to be the origin used in the
    string representation. But don't refer to this attribute
    elsewhere in your implementation; the information should not
    be necessary.
